## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Very Easy and short way to center a element in CSS!

```css
body {
  /* Make card center */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

The CSS variables are really usefull!! I'll be using them in every project.

```css
element {
  --variable-name: value;
}
```

Also the rem & em units are great help for responsive designs.

```css
element {
  property: 1rem;
}
```
